Asteroidal Lander
=================
A game inspired by `Lunar Lander`_, but with Newtonian gravity and my
best attempt at rigid-body physics.

I want to play!
---------------
I'm going to set up a gh-pages for this soon, but in the meantime, you
can run it in development mode:

.. code:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/benburrill/asteroidal-lander
    $ cd asteroidal-lander
    $ npm install
    $ npm run live

Then navigate to the link in your browser

Wait, how do I play?
--------------------
| **Left/Right** arrows to fire turning thrusters
| **Down** to automatically slow your rotation
| **Up** to fire the main engine
| **Spacebar** to speed up time

WASD can be used in place of the arrow keys if desired.

Your goal is to land on the magenta-colored areas of the asteroid.  Keep
an eye on your fuel level and try not to crash.  This isn't some dinky
little landing module, it's a massive colony ship!
